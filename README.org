* Recursive Junction Tree Algorithm
A very minimal toy-box for my own curiosity about the junction tree algorithm implemented using recursion as opposed https://github.com/mlindsk/jti. Since I'm only interested in the message passing mechanism in the recursion I do not intend to implement actual clique potentials. These are just scalars here to make things easy. 

The (simple) rules for updating is as folllows: In =collect_evidence= the scalar of a node is updated to be twice the scalar value of the child. In =distribute_evidence= the scalar of a node is updated to be half the scalar value of the parent.


Run the code as usual with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
g++ junction_tree_algorithm.cpp
#+END_SRC

and see the result 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./a.out
#+END_SRC
